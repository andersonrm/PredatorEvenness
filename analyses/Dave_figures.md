## Overview

This is a first attempt at plotting Dave’s richness/evenness experiment.

All curves are generated by:

![y \sim {\sf Poisson}(\mu\_{i})](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?y%20%5Csim%20%7B%5Csf%20Poisson%7D%28%5Cmu_%7Bi%7D%29 "y \sim {\sf Poisson}(\mu_{i})")

![\log(\mu\_{i})=\beta\_{0}+\beta\_{1}x\_{i}+\beta\_{2}x\_{i}^{2}](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Clog%28%5Cmu_%7Bi%7D%29%3D%5Cbeta_%7B0%7D%2B%5Cbeta_%7B1%7Dx_%7Bi%7D%2B%5Cbeta_%7B2%7Dx_%7Bi%7D%5E%7B2%7D "\log(\mu_{i})=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}x_{i}+\beta_{2}x_{i}^{2}")

where
![\mu\_{i}](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmu_%7Bi%7D "\mu_{i}")
is the mean of alive beetles, and
![x](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?x "x") is the predator
abundance.

## Methods

1)  There were three possible natural enemy species (Bb, Hm, Sc)

2)  Treatments included either 1 species or all 3 species

3)  There were 3 single species treatments (each species by itself)

4)  There were 3 treatments with all three species. In these treatments,
    we varied the evenness from low to medium to high. In “low” evenness
    treatments the 3 species were distributed 90%, 5%, 5%. In “medium”
    evenness treatments the 3 species were distributed 60%, 20%, 20%. In
    “high evenness treatments the 3 species were distributed 33.3%,
    33.3%, 33.3%. We also made sure that each species was the dominant
    species in an equal number of replicates in “low” in “medium”
    treatments, so the experiment was fully factorial.

5)  We varied the abundance of individual species and the total
    community abundance from 100 to 400 to 1000 to 4000 to 10000
